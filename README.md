## 👤 About Me

LexiLink was born out of a desire to make dense documents more accessible. As a student and AI enthusiast, I often found myself buried in long research papers, technical manuals, and course PDFs — wasting time skimming through pages just to find one useful paragraph.

I built LexiLink to change that.

This project combines my passion for **AI**, **natural language processing**, and **user-friendly tools** into a practical assistant that helps anyone interact with information more efficiently. Whether you’re a student, a researcher, or a curious mind, LexiLink aims to save you time and make your documents talk back.

I believe in open-source tools that empower learners. If you find this useful or want to build on it — feel free to fork, modify, and make it your own.

_Thanks for checking out LexiLink — let’s make knowledge more accessible, one PDF at a time._
